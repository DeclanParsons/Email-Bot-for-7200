Before emails can be sent we need to create a Gmail app. 
### 2FA with Gmail

While singed into the account you are choosing to use make sure to setup 2FA with your phone number and backup email.

### Creating your app 

To create your app stay logged into your account that has 2FA enabled.

Simply pick a name for your app and copy the password it creates you. This is the password that will be used in the program. 

### Sending Your First Email

Input your email account that you used to create the app (must also be singed into your account before running program) and your app password that you generated.
